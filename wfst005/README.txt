Converts English word sequence into syllable-stress pattern.  This device 
produces multiple outputs, since some words are ambiguous (is PRISONER three 
syllables or two?), and since one-syllable words can sometimes be stressed.

Usage:

% echo '"BUILT" "IN" "PRISONS" "AND" "THE" "REST" "OF" "THE" "EPIC"' | carmel -sliOEQk 5 wfst005
Input line 1: "BUILT" "IN" "PRISONS" "AND" "THE" "REST" "OF" "THE" "EPIC"

Improvement direction:

This device only has a 20k vocabulary (word types used in English poetry 
that this model was trained on).  For example, it has:
	NEAR
	NEARED
	NEARER
	NEAREST
	NEARING
	NEARLY
	NEARS
but not NEARLY.  With a little cleverness, the CMU pronouncing dictionary 
could be used to add an additional 90k word types.
